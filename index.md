I'm a research software engineer with an interest in machine learning, particularly NLP.

I currently work in UCL's [Clinical Research Informatics Unit (CRIU)](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/clinical-research-informatics-unit) working on natural language processing techniques and software for use with electronic health records.

I previously worked on [Project Odysseus](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/project-odysseus-understanding-london-busyness-and-exiting-lockdown) at the Warwick Machine Learning Group
