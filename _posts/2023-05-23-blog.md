I've been trying to understand machine learning in more deeply. I need a solid understanding of the innards so I can confidently work on playing with and designing models.

I am following the example (and have copied the site) of Gregory Gundersen. See: [Why I Keep a Research Blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/) and [How I Built This Blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/).

TL;DR: Having to explain something is a good way of learning things, and the idea that someone *might* read it encourages accuracy.
